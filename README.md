# BrownianMotion_model
A python script that generates paths for the geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and arithmetic Brownian motion (ABM) models.
The code also includes a main function called ``mainCalculation()`` that generates and plots 25 paths for the GBM and ABM models.

To run the code, simply save it as a Python file (e.g. ``path.py``) and run it in a terminal or command prompt:
```
python path.py
```

This will generate two plots:

* The first plot shows the simulated log-stock prices for the GBM and ABM models.
* The second plot shows the simulated stock prices for the GBM and ABM models.

You can adjust the parameters in the mainCalculation() function to generate paths for different models and parameter values.

## Uses
Paths of the arithmetic Brownian motion (ABM) and geometric Brownian motion (GBM) models can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

* Simulating the future prices of assets: ABM and GBM models can be used to simulate the future prices of assets such as stocks, bonds, and commodities. This can be useful for forecasting price movements and making investment decisions.
* Pricing derivatives: ABM and GBM models are used to price a variety of derivative securities, such as options, futures, and swaps.
* Risk management: ABM and GBM models can be used to assess and manage the risk of financial portfolios.
* Research: ABM and GBM models are used in academic research to study a variety of financial phenomena, such as asset pricing, market efficiency, and the behavior of investors.
